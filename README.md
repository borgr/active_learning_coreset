# Active Learning via Core-Sets
Source code for ICLR 2018 Paper: Active Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks: A Core-Set Approach

## Main Organization of the Code	

- additional_baselines:
  - This folder includes baselines as well as pytorch implementation of the CIFAR-10 VGG network training code.
- coreset
  - This folder includes the discrete optimization code which given feature embeddings, solves for core-sets. Its output chosen ids which is further used by learning code.

## Training 

- Training code uses http://torch.ch/blog/2015/07/30/cifar.html

## Greedy Solver
- If you only need a greedy solver, you can use https://github.com/google/active-learning/blob/master/sampling_methods/kcenter_greedy.py
